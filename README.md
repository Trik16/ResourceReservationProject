# **ResourceReservationProject**
This is a simple but complete exercise to learning Python

## Task and flow chart
We are going to do a new branch of the existing ResPa project from Helsinki City with some major difference. The final task is to have a resource booking app. But, we are still learning, for steps.

For learning porpouse I've imagined an app to book some tables from a list of pubs(or discord servers). And when you book a table there will be also a google calendar events associated.

## What we are going to study?

| **Subject** | **Element** | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Database | MongoDB and PostgreSQL | Analize and rewrite |
| Backend | The main code is in Python, Django module | Analize and rewrite |
| API | REST architecture, Flask module, Interface | Write ex-novo |
| CLI Frontend | Telegram and Discord API for BOT | Write ex-novo |
| Frontend | Flutter module | For application interface |

## languages

- Python
- SQL
- JavaScript

## STEPS

- Create a study group
- Discuss the competences to learn and needs
- Study ResPa code
- Create new branch of ResPa 
- Rewrite Django and turn into flask
- Remove SQL DB to a NoSQL DB
- Write Telegram and Discord interface
- Develop the app into docker and kubernetes (we must write cloud native app)

In a second moment we could also:
- Write interface of an Android/iOS app with Flutter
